\f0\fs24 \cf0 bug1 (high Priority) (SOLVED)\
	- Some transaction descriptions can be different. They might have two \'93Purchase\'94 words inside the text. This will cause problems when splitting the long whole text when using whole_string.replace(\'93Purchase\'94, \'93\\n\'94). Eventually some important info will be lost. And in fact, it resulted in miss-calculation of the total amount of withdrawals.\
\
What needs to be done?\
- make sure this type of transaction, that had a cash back withdrawal (apparently this is the cause of having description text different), gets treated correctly by a class, without loosing important information about other amounts which are needed to get the total amount correct.\
